# book-list
A simple book list app to create a record of books and save it in the local storage using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

What I Learned:

•	Used the Skeleton boilerplate for plain HTML
•	Used the DOM Manipulation for user interaction like how to add or remove books from the book list
•	Learned how to store and delete data through the local storage in the browser
•	Learned how to refractor from the old JS syntaxes to the new ES6 syntaxes.
